  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <div class="statement-item">
    <p>I am a digital media artist and illustrator. My work often stems from my personal experiences with mental health and I often use pastel palettes for my illustrations. I feel that having a digital medium makes it easier to share across many
      different platforms. Having grown up in a digital age, it is easier to express and make artwork that is based on my first experiences using the internet and electronics. I am seeking new challenges and opportunities for professional growth and
      skill development with an emphasis on refining my illustration skills and learning design principles.

      As a young artist, I am still in the process of discovering what it is I want to convey with my art. I think that art does not have to have deep meaning or hidden message and should still be considered art even if it were made just for
      aesthetic reasons. Because of this, I often find myself making art purely because it is what I want to make rather then it be made with a specific message in mind.
