       <h3>Self-Reflection, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
       <p>This is a digital composite image using various images I found online. The marble statues, which remind me of weeping angels, depicts the unsettling feeling I get when looking into the bathroom mirror alone. The water on the floor could be from the overflowing sinks or perhaps tears. </p>

      <h3>Ambience, Sound Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This piece combines my own field recordings of a trickling water fountain, the sound of people talking and the bathroom. I created a composite of these three different sounds in order to express how I feel when walking through the Student Union during peak times. As I walk through, it is often so busy that the sound of people talking or using the facilities begins to merge and melt into one. </p>

       <h3>Raining Cows, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
       <p>This is a digital composite images using various asian drinks and cows. A large part of my childhood involved asian drinks such as aloe, soy milk and banana milk. While normal milk is seen as a basic necessity, to me, drinks made to be a different flavor are much better. </p>
