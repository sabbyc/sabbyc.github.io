         <h3>Freeway, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
         <p>The digital video combines my own recorded video as well as my own recorded sound. Driving down the freeway in the evening often puts me into a daze as I see the sun setting. The ticking represents the feeling of the drive being soporific and dull. </p>

       <h3>Self-Reflection, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
       <p>This is a digital composite image using various images I found online. The marble statues, which remind me of weeping angels, depicts the unsettling feeling I get when looking into the bathroom mirror alone. The water on the floor could be from the overflowing sinks or perhaps tears. </p>

       <h3>Pokemon Battle, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
       <p>This is a digital composite image using a scenic forest image and pokemon pixel sprites. As a kid, I often dreamed about what it would be like if pokemon existed in the real world but when I imagine this - I am often in the same world shown in the Pokemon show. I think seeing the mixed art styles (from the games, shows, etc) offers a new perspective to my dream as a kid. </p>

      <h3>Ambience, Sound Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This piece combines my own field recordings of a trickling water fountain, the sound of people talking and the bathroom. I created a composite of these three different sounds in order to express how I feel when walking through the Student Union during peak times. As I walk through, it is often so busy that the sound of people talking or using the facilities begins to merge and melt into one. </p>

       <h3>Raining Cows, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
       <p>This is a digital composite images using various asian drinks and cows. A large part of my childhood involved asian drinks such as aloe, soy milk and banana milk. While normal milk is seen as a basic necessity, to me, drinks made to be a different flavor are much better. </p>

       <h3>Milk carton, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
       <p>This is a glitched digital image of an art piece that I drew digitally. This was originally done for a class exercise, where we experimented glitching images using either Audacity or by editing the text itself.</p>

       <h3>Self-Portrait, Interactive Net Art, 2019 </h3>
       <p>This interactive net art is a self-portrait of myself in the digital world. Each link is an ad that I have gotten suggested for me. Some ads are accurate while others are not but that is for the viewer to see.</p>
