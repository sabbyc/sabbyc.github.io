    <p>I am a digital artist and illustrator.I feel that having a digital medium makes it easier to share across many different platforms. Having grown up in a digital age, it is easier to express and make artwork that is based on my first experiences using the internet and electronics. I am seeking new challenges and opportunities for professional growth and skill development.  </p>
