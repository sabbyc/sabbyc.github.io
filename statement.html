    <p>I work digitally (images, coding, and illustrations) as I feel that a digital medium makes it easier to share across many different platforms. Having grown up in a digital age, it is easier to express and make artwork that is based on my first experiences using the internet and electronics.  </p>

<p>While my memories serve as the idea/basis for an artwork, the presentation and aesthetic is based off of my personal preferences such as pastels and playful energy. Though it may not be apparent, the inspiration of many of my works comes from video games, shows and my own experiences growing up as an Asian American. </p>
